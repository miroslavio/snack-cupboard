# Future Enhancements

## Bulk Operations

- **Bulk Archive**: Select multiple staff/items and archive them at once
- **Bulk Restore**: Restore multiple archived records
- **Bulk Hard Delete**: Permanently delete multiple archived records with confirmation
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Add checkboxes to table rows
  - "Select All" toggle
  - Bulk action buttons appear when items selected
  - Batch API endpoints for efficiency
  - Clear confirmation modals showing count and list of affected records

## Other Considerations

- **Search within archived**: Option to search only archived or both active+archived
- **Archive date display**: Show when items/staff were archived in the table
- **Restore with edits**: Allow editing details when restoring archived records
- **Export archived data**: CSV export of archived staff/items for record keeping
